# Welcome to My Obsidian Weblog

This is the main page of my knowledge base. Here I collect thoughts, ideas, and connect them together.

## Getting Started

You can navigate through the knowledge base using:
- [[JavaScript]] - Learn about programming
- [[Personal Projects]] - My ongoing work
- [[Reading Notes]] - Book summaries and thoughts

## Features

This weblog supports:
- **Backlinks**: Connect notes using `[[Note Name]]` syntax
- **Graph View**: Visual representation of connections
- **Automatic Publishing**: Push to GitHub and deploy automatically

Feel free to explore the [graph view](graph.html) to see how everything connects!
