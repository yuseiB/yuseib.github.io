# JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that I use for [[Personal Projects]].

## Key Concepts

- **Asynchronous Programming**: Using promises and async/await
- **DOM Manipulation**: Interacting with web pages
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript

## Learning Resources

I keep my [[Reading Notes]] about JavaScript books here.

## Projects

Most of my [[Personal Projects]] involve JavaScript in some way, especially this weblog system.
